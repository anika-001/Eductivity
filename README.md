Our Key Features:

- ##### :books: Study:
As students we tend to search a lot, visiting each website like Wikipedia, Google Scholar, Khan Academy, etc takes a lot of time to look for the right information. Here, in this feature, the user can search anything and see the results parallelly on the websites like Khan Academy, Google Scholar, and more, taking your search to the next level!

- ##### :newspaper: News and updates:
To keep pace with changing times, being updated with the latest developments is crucial. The feature keeps users informed and updated with the latest developments and updates. 

- ##### :sparkles: Calm room:
At times all we need is just a place to sit down and relax. Calm room is that place with soothing beach waves in the background, a place to rest. Because Rest is also equally productive.

- ##### :smile: Mood Tracker and Notes:
A place to jot down all the notes and have them handy anytime! Moreover, color the tracker with the shades of your mood!
